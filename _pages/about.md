My name is Thatchayut Unjitwattana, but most of you probably know me as ***Tay***. I'm a biomedical engineering Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan. My current research interests include, but are not limited to, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis of cancer and placenta tissues, integrating spatial transcriptomics with graph neural network models for cell-cell communication inference, and drug repurposing using spatial transcriptomic data. 

Fun fact about me: 
* Some people may call me Thai/Tai, as it's a bit confusing when I introduce myself as Tay from Thailand.
* I drink coffee at least 3 cups a day.
  * (Scientific fact) *"The previous study found that the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease was reduced by 60% by drinking one to two cups of coffee a day."* [[Wang et al. 2024, Nature - scientific reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-71426-y)]
* When I'm not at work, I'd probably be (secretly) strolling around the Ann Arbor area and singing with [Huron Valley Harmonizer](https://sites.google.com/view/hvharmonizers).
