My name is Thatchayut Unjitwattana, but most of you probably know me as ***Tay***. I'm a biomedical engineering Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan. My current research interests include, but are not limited to, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis of cancer and placenta tissues, integrating spatial transcriptomics with graph neural network models for cell-cell communication inference, and drug repurposing using spatial transcriptomic data. 

Fun fact about me: 
* When I'm not at work, I'd probably be (secretly) strolling around the Ann Arbor area and singing with [Huron Valley Harmonizer](https://sites.google.com/view/hvharmonizers).
