Get to know me
======
My name is Thatchayut Unjitwattana, but most of you may know me by ***Tay***. I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan in the Biomedical Engineering department. My current research interests include, but are not limited to, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis of cancer and placenta tissues, integrating spatial transcriptomics with graph neural network models for cell-cell communication inference, and drug repurposing using spatial transcriptomic data. 

Fun fact about me: 
* Some people may call me Thai/Tai, as it's a bit confusing when I introduce myself as Tay from Thailand.
* When I'm not at work, I'd probably (and secretly) be strolling around the Ann Arbor area and singing with [Huron Valley Harmonizer](https://sites.google.com/view/hvharmonizers).
