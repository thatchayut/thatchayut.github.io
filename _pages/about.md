My name is Thatchayut Unjitwattana, but most of you may know me by ***Tay***. I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan in the Biomedical Engineering department. My current research interests include, but are not limited to, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis of cancer and placenta tissues, integrating spatial transcriptomics with graph neural network models for cell-cell communication inference, and drug repurposing using spatial transcriptomic data. 

Fun fact about me: 
* Some people may call me Thai/Tai, as it's a bit confusing when I introduce myself as Tay from Thailand.
* I drink coffee at least 3 cups a day.
  * (Scientific fact) *"A recent dose-response meta-analysis disclosed that an extra two-cups of coffee per day reduced the risk of HCC by 35%"* [[Fan 2022, Frontiers in Oncology](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9623052/)]
* When I'm not at work, I'd probably (and secretly) be strolling around the Ann Arbor area and singing with [Huron Valley Harmonizer](https://sites.google.com/view/hvharmonizers).
